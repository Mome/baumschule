	title = {Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09246},
	abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of image representation learning without human annotation. Following the principles of self-supervision, we build a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) that can be trained to solve Jigsaw puzzles as a pretext task, which requires no manual labeling, and then later repurposed to solve object classification and detection. To maintain the compatibility across tasks we introduce the context-free network ({CFN}), a Siamese-ennead {CNN}. The {CFN} takes image tiles as input and explicitly limits the receptive field (or context) of its early processing units to one tile at a time. We show that the {CFN} is a more compact version of {AlexNet}, but with the same semantic learning capabilities. By training the {CFN} to solve Jigsaw puzzles, we learn both a feature mapping of object parts as well as their cor-rect spatial arrangement. Our experimental evaluations show that the learned features capture semantically relevant content. The performance in object detection of features extracted from the {CFN} is the highest (51.8\%) among unsupervisedly trained features, and very close to that of supervisedly trained features (56.5\%). In object classification the {CFN} features achieve also the best accuracy (38.1\%) among unsupervisedly trained features on the {ImageNet} 2012 dataset.},

Probabalisttc state/transition space is the general representation employed, and directed graphs depicting states and the possible transitions between those states is the common methodology representing structure f or both the hard and sof t aspects of inf ormation systems. A key quantitative property of these graphs is the conditional probability characterizing each transition between states. The reasons for these choices are cited, information entropy measures are applied to the graphs, and calculations using the transition probabilities are shown to be able to characterize, describe, and simplify the behavior of inf ormation systems in general. One result of these analyses is that the probability of states in an inf ormation system needs to be treated as a complex variable in order to handle constraints typically placed on such systems.},

	abstract = {Despite recent breakthroughs in the applications of deep neural networks, one setting that presents a persistent challenge is that of "one-shot learning." Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often through extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines ({NTMs}), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-based focusing mechanisms.},

Though Ramsey proposed this view, he did not actually establish it in a way that showed an authentically logical character for the probability axioms (he started the current fashion for generating probabilities from suitably constrained preferences over uncertain options). Other people have also sought to provide the probability calculus with a logical character, though also unsuccessfully. The present paper gives a completeness and soundness theorem supporting a logical interpretation: the syntax is the probability axioms, and the semantics is that of fairness (for bets).},

	abstract = {Several grammar-based genetic programming algorithms have been proposed in the literature
to automatically generate heuristics for hard optimisation problems. These approaches specify the
algorithmic building blocks and the way in which they can be combined in a grammar; the best
heuristic for the problem being tackled is found by an evolutionary algorithm that searches in the
algorithm design space defined by the grammar.
In this work, we propose a novel representation of the grammar into a sequence of categorical,
integer, and real-valued parameters. We then use a tool for automatic algorithm configuration to
search for the best algorithm for the problem at hand. Our experimental evaluation on the onedimensional
bin packing problem and the permutation flowshop problem with weighted tardiness
objective shows that the proposed approach improves over grammatical evolution, a well-established
variant of grammar-based genetic programming. The reasons behind such improvement lie both in
the representation proposed, as well as in the method used to search the algorithm design space.},

Compared to traditional Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) and Gated Recurrent Unit ({GRU}), both structures require fewer parameters and less computation time in sequence classification tasks. Unlike {GRU} and {LSTM}, which require more than one gates to control information flow in the network, {SGU} and {DSGU} only use one multiplicative gate to control the flow of information. We show that this difference can accelerate the learning speed in tasks that require long dependency information. We also show that {DSGU} is more numerically stable than {SGU}. In addition, we also propose a standard way of representing inner structure of {RNN} called {RNN} Conventional Graph ({RCG}), which helps analyzing the relationship between input units and hidden units of {RNN}.},

@inproceedings{hutter_automatic_2007,
	title = {Automatic Algorithm Configuration based on Local Search},
	abstract = {The determination of appropriate values for free algorithm parameters is a challenging and tedious task in the design of effective algorithms for hard problems. Such parameters include categorical choices (e.g., neighborhood structure in local search or variable/value ordering heuristics in tree search), as well as numerical parameters (e.g., noise or restart timing). In practice, tuning of these parameters is largely carried out manually by applying rules of thumb and crude heuristics, while more principled approaches are only rarely used. In this paper, we present a local search approach for algorithm configuration and prove its convergence to the globally optimal parameter configuration. Our approach is very versatile: it can, e.g., be used for minimising run-time in decision problems or for maximising solution quality in optimisation problems. It further applies to arbitrary algorithms, including heuristic tree search and local search algorithms, with no limitation on the number of parameters. Experiments in four algorithm configuration scenarios demonstrate that our automatically determined parameter settings always outperform the algorithm defaults, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. Our approach also shows better performance and greater flexibility than the recent {CALIBRA} system. Our {ParamILS} code, along with instructions on how to use it for tuning your own algorithms, is available on-line at},

The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity.

To alleviate this situation, we propose to develop programming languages for machine learning and data mining. We also argue that such languages should be declarative and should be based on constraint programming modeling principles. In this way, one could declaratively specify the problem of machine learning or data mining problem of interest in a high-level modeling language and then translate it into a constraint satisfaction or optimization problem, which could then be solved using particular solvers. These ideas are illustrated on problems of constraint-based itemset and pattern set mining.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density – the Fourier transform of a kernel – with a Gaussian mixture.
The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric {CO}2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that it is possible to reconstruct several popular standard covariances within our framework.},

A wide variety of hybrid approaches have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, a taxonomy of hybrid metaheuristics is presented in an attempt to provide a common terminology and classification mechanisms. The taxonomy, while presented in terms of metaheuristics, is also applicable to most types of heuristics and exact optimization algorithms.
As an illustration of the usefulness of the taxonomy an annoted bibliography is given which classifies a large number of hybrid approaches according to the taxonomy.},

This framework has been learned by us, validated and improved over a period of more than two years by participating in online machine learning competitions. It aims at minimizing human interference required to build a first useful predictive model and to assess the practical difficulty of a given machine learning challenge. The proposed system helps in identifying data types, choosing a machine learn- ing model, tuning hyper-parameters, avoiding over-fitting and optimization for a provided evaluation metric. We also observe that the proposed system produces better (or comparable) results with less runtime as compared to other approaches.},

	abstract = {The success of hand-crafted machine learning systems in many applications raises the question of making machine learning algorithms more autonomous, i.e., to reduce the requirement of expert input to a minimum. We discuss two strategies towards this goal: (1) automated optimization of hyperparameters (including mechanisms for feature selection, preprocessing, model selection, etc) and (2) the development of algorithms with reduced sets of hyperparameters. Since many research directions (e.g., deep learning), show a tendency towards increasingly complex algorithms with more and more hyperparamters, the demand for both of these strategies continuously increases. We review recent hyperparameter optimization methods and discuss data-driven approaches to avoid the introduction of hyperparameters using unsupervised learning. We end in discussing how these complementary strategies can work hand-in-hand, representing a very promising approach towards autonomous machine learning.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07427},
	abstract = {Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that can be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed in a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with backpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories. On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to train than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to incorporate Maximum Inner Product Search ({MIPS}) in the training and inference procedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various state-of-the art approximate {MIPS} techniques and report results on {SimpleQuestions}, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.},

Theoretical and experimental results illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as the experimental optimization of the performance of a system with a very general multipeak performance function when the only available information is noise-distributed samples of the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to optimization with respect to one system parameter. The observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of the next observation may be interpreted as the location of the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate) for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown function, and the observations are interpreted with respect to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system optimization.},

	shorttitle = {Synergetic Computers and Cognition},
	abstract = {This book presents a novel approach to neural nets and thus offers a genuine alternative to the hitherto known neuro-computers. This approach is based on the author's discovery of the profound analogy between pattern recognition and pattern formation in open systems far from equilibrium. Thus the mathematical and conceptual tools of synergetics can be exploited, and the concept of the synergetic computer formulated. A complete and rigorous theory of pattern recognition and learning is presented. The resulting algorithm can be implemented on serial computers or realized by fully parallel nets whereby no spurious states occur. Explicit examples (recognition of faces and city maps) are provided. The recognition process is made invariant with respect to simultaneous translation, rotation, and scaling, and allows the recognition of complex scenes. Oscillations and hysteresis in the perception of ambiguous patterns are treated, as well as the recognition of movement patterns. A comparison between the recognition abilities of humans and the synergetic computer sheds new light on possible models of mental processes. The synergetic computer can also perform logical steps such as the {XOR} operation. The new edition includes a section on transformation properties of the equations of the synergetic computer and on the invariance properties of the order parameter equations. Further additions are a new section on stereopsis and recent developments in the use of pulse-coupled neural nets for pattern recognition.},

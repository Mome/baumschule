During its history the field of software engeneering was subject to a continual change. New affordances to computer systems forced developers to consistanty adopt concepts from academic fields into their own skill sets. The raising complexity in software projects gave birth high level programming languages that are easier to grasp for the human mind, which makes code generation and maintainance tractable for complex applications.
In recent years, the increading amount of digital data, poses a untractable challange for conventional desing approaches. As a consequence techniques from  areas like machine learning are inceasingly applied.

Due to the large amount of digital information collected in modern society the need for automated data processing and analysis tools rises in many areas of the industry. The

This work proposes a formalism to state optimization problems by describing the structure of a wide range of search spaces together with an algorithm adopted from the field of hyperparamter-optimization as an approach to high level machine learning.



The mathematical branch of Optimization is mathematical programming, where a mathematical program referes to an optimization problem with additional equality and inequality constraints.

\section{Hyperparameter Optimization}
In Bayesain statistics the term \textit{hyperparameter} referes to the a parameter of the prior distribution. In \textit{hierarchical models} the priors distribution over the hyperparamters are called \textit{hyperpriors} respectively \cite[p.408]{bishop_neural_1995}. In \acf{ML} a hyperparameter is any parameter that needs to be assigned before the training of other parameters can begin.
\acf{HPO} Other terms for \ac{HPO} are hyperarameter \textit{tuning} or \textit{search}. Also \textit{model selection} means essentially the same thing, the focus is however more on the selection criterions.
The ususal \ac{HPO} procedure ...
Key characteristics of a \ac{HPO} problems are:
\paragraph{Long evaluation times}
\paragraph{Little knowledge} of the objective function
\paragraph{varying complexity} of search space ranging from simple homogenic cartesian search spaces to heterogenic graph shaped spaces.

\subsection{Machine Learning as Optimization}



Most \acf{ML} problems are expressable as optimization problems \cite{bennett_interplay_2006}.

\paragraph{Types and Error Functions}


\paragraph{Model Selection}



\begin{quote}
Machine learning algorithms, however, have certain characteristics that distinguish them from other black-box optimization problems.  First, each function evaluation can require a variable amount of time:  training a small neural network with 10 hidden units will take less time than a bigger net-work with 1000 hidden units.  Even without considering duration, the advent of cloud computing makes it possible to quantify economically the cost of requiring large-memory machines for learning, changing the actual cost in dollars of an experiment with a different number of hidden units.

\paragraph{Assumptions}
...

\subsection{Structure and Construction of Search Spaces}
The majority of \ac{HPO} algorithms are designed for domains of the form $\mathbb{R}^n$.
The basic idea underlying the construction of parameter spaces is that variables do not need to possess a unique value assingment, but can rather have a set of or possible values. Instead of saying $x = 1$ one can say that $x$ equals ether one or two. Any other operations that Finally this set of computation graphes can be applied to a performance measure, expressing an optimization problem with instances of the computation graph set as possible solutions.

The basic idea of the search space descriprion lies in the declaration of variables.
\subsubsection{Primitive Spaces}
The smallest unit of a search spaces is a primitive space. It is a one dimensional collection of possible instances of a parameter. Every search space is ether a primitive space of a combination of primitive spaces.

\paragraph{Categorical}
Categoriacal parameters have a finite unsorted domain of numerical or non-numerical values. This type is used for nominal scaled parameters like labels in a classification problem, basis-functions in linear regression or different activation functions in feedforward neural networks.

\paragraph{Continuous}
Continues parametes are bounded or unbounded intervals over the real numbers. This type would, for example, be used for a regularization parameter or the discount factor in Q-learning.

\paragraph{Discrete}
Values of a discrete parameters are numerical. The cardinality of a discrete parameter is finite or countable (if defined over an unbounded interval).
Other than categorical parameters, but similar to continous parameters, discrete parameters have a distance over their elements. If two elements are close, than the value of the objective fucntion is also assumed to be closed. This type is, for example, used as the number of layers in a neural network.

\subsubsection{Combinations}

\paragraph{Product}
The product lines up multiple search spaces to form a sequence of search spaces.
The search space becomes multi-dimensional and the values becomes tuples. The product of some primitive parameter spaces $A = {a,b}$ and $B = {x,y}$ is written as:
$$\operatorname{prod}(A, B) = A \times B$$

\paragraph{Joining}
Two search spaces $A$ and $B$ can be joined to form a new search space $C$, containing all elements of $A$ and $B$. The join is expressed by a union symbol $\cup$. To enable programming language integration, in reseblence to the baccus naur form joining, the pipe symbol is an alias for the join.
$$ \operatorname{join}(A, B) = A \cup B = A\ |\ B $$


\paragraph{Renaming}
An item in a tuple of parameters can be renamed. A renamed tuple can be expressed as an indexed family.

$$(A, B) = (A_{0}, B_{1})$$

In resemblence to relational algebra $\rho$ is used to refer to the rename.

$$\rho_{1/a}((A_{0}, B_{1})) = (A_{0}, B_{a}) = (A, a:B)$$

The product of two parameter families is defined as follows. If all indices are integers the product is a usual cartesian product. The length of the first tumples is added to all indices of the second tuples.
$$(0{:}A, 1{:}B) \times (0{:}C, 1{:}D) = (0{:}A, 1{:}B, 2{:}C, 3{:}D)$$
Non-integer indices are simply copied to the resulting family.
$$(0:A,\ \beta:B) \times (0:C,\ \delta:D) = (0:A,\ 1:C, \beta:B,\ \delta:D)$$
The prodcut is undefined if two non-positional parameters share the same key.


\paragraph{Application}
With the apply combination the application of an abitrary function to the elements of a search space can be expressed.
$$ f(A \cup B) = f(A) \cup f(B) $$
Spaces can also be applied to other spaces.
$$(f \cup g)(A) = f(A) \cup g(A)$$

With function application it becomes possible to express \textit{dependendencies} between parameters.

$$A = f(B) \cup g(C)$$

If $B \neq C$ then the function $f$ and $g$ have different parameter domains. The choice of the parameter is dependent on previous choice of the function.  The structure of the search space is not a vector any more but becomes a tree.

\paragraph{Recursion}
With recursion it is possibel to express grammars.

$$ A = (\ \mathbb{N}\ \cup\ f(\mathbb{N}, A)\ ) $$

The extension of an expression is defined as the  :

$$ A = \{\mathbb{N},\ f(\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N}),\ f(\mathbb{N}, f(\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N})), ... \}$$

In this way the function nesting can become arbitrary deep. The search space becomes an infinite tree, but the instances stay finite trees.

\paragraph{Expression Equality}
Context free grammars can produce identical strings with a different sequence of production application. The same is true for parameter space definitions.
If a function to measure the equality of two expressions is added to the system, the search space obtains the structure of a directed acyclic graph.
Two expressions can have the same meaning even if the representations are not equal.


\vspace*{0.5cm}
\hspace*{-1cm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{search_space_hierachy.pdf}

\paragraph{Constants}
So far it is only possible to express search spaces over function trees.
A value that is computed once can only be used in a single other function call. With the introduction of \textit{constants} it is possible to remember the output of computation tree evaluation.
The structure of the describable structure is extended to a DAG and is called a \textit{computation graph}.
Constants allow to express structures beyond the capabilities of a constext free grammar. For example to express a search space over matricies with arbitray size.

\paragraph{Variables}
Variables are like constants, with additional ability to change value in the computation process. The elements of the search space obtain a cylic graph structures.

\subsection{Aquisition Functions}

\subsubsection{Probability of Improvement}
\subsubsection{Expected Improvement}

Expected Information (EI) is the most widely used aquistion function. First use was 1998 \cite{jones_efficient_1998}.

$$ \EI(y|x) \coloneqq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \max(0, y^*-y)p(y|x)dy $$

For the one-dimensional case a simple closes form formula can be derivated:

$$ \EI(y|x) = \int_{-\infty}^{y^*}(y^*-y)p(y|x)dy$$

$$ = \int_{-\infty}^{y^*}(y^*-y)\normal(y; \mu, \sigma)dy =
\int_{-\infty}^{y^*}(y^*-y)\normal(y-\mu; 0, \sigma)dy$$

$$ = \int_{-\infty}^{y^*}(y^*- t - \mu)\normal(t; 0, \sigma)dt $$

$$ = (y^*-\mu)\int_{-\infty}^{y^*}\normal(t; 0, \sigma)dt - \int_{-\infty}^{y^*}t\cdot\normal(t; 0, \sigma)dt$$

$$ = (y^*-\mu)\Phi(y^*/\sigma) - \phi(y^*/\sigma) $$

Where $\phi$ and $\Phi$ refere to the PDF and CDF of the standart normal distribution.

\subsection{Aquisition optimization}
The use of a model and an aquisition function leads to a new non-convex optimization problem. Algorithms to find the maximum of the figure of merrit include global optimization technics uschas: DIRECT, L-BFGS-B, ...

\subsubsection{Recommendation Strategy}
The need for a recommendation strategy arises for noisy objective functions. In the deterministic setting the maximal aquisition value becomes the recommendation for the next evaluation step. For non-deterministic aquisition function one needs to generate a sample from a distribution over aquisition values. Strategies like returning the maximum observed value or returning the optimal latent posterior mean can be encountered. Different objective function can require different strategies \cite{hoffman_modular_2014}.

\section{Extension to Recursive Seach Spaces}

This section describes an algorithm that extends Bayesian optimization algorithms to grammar based search spaces.

Consider the recursive function tree definition of $G$:

$$ G = (\ A\ |\ f(G,G)\ )$$

Based on the rule application in context free grammar, one can select a subset of $G$ by choosing ether $A$ or $f(G,G)$.
$$ A \subset G\ \land\ f(G,G) \subset G$$

$$G \subset (G+\mathbb{N}) \subset (G+\mathbb{N}+\mathbb{N})$$

\subsection{Parallelization}

\subsection{Integration with Manual Search}
Manual guidance before and during the optimization process.

\subsubsection{Prior Information}
In machine learning preknowledge about the learning task can be consindered as choice and distribution over the hypothesis space. This is determined rather indirect by the choice of the \ac{ML}-algorithm and its hyperparameters (or distribution over hyperparameters) or in Bayesian method directly expressed via prior probabilities. Since gaussian processes regession is used here, the choice of the kernel
Prior infotmation can for example be an actual probabilistic prior over the search space. For random sampling this probability can just be used as the sampling probability. For model-based methods, which have no direct sampling, this probability can be interpreted as \textit{probability of improvement} or (more plausible) as \textit{probability of optimum}.

\subsubsection{Search Hints}
A concept I labeled \textit{search hints} is a way to express external knowledge about the search space. I contranst to regular prior knowledge search hits can also be injected into search process on the fly. Intuitively a search hint just denotes good region to search. And once again it is not obvious how to translate this human instructions into the search process.
The easier part is to construct a probability distribution only from hints. If a hint is interpreted as a sample from the space of the probability of optimum then distribution estimation methods like Parzen-Window can be used. If one takes a squard exponential kernel, a hint translates to good region. To indicate better regions one would need to give multiple of samples from the same region, which is unfavourable. To solve this one could give weighted hints. Once again there are different ways to do this.
First one could assign the probability of optimium directly to a region. This however is hard to conceptualize for users and requires not to violate the normalization property (sum of hints must not excede one).
A second way is to allow values between zero and one, fit a curve, and normlize aferwards to get a probability of optimum. Which is much better, because a value of zero keeps the interpretation of zero probability and one get the interpretation of maximum probability. If one allows arbitrary big values for hints the down scaling of former hints could become easier. If one allows also negative values, and includes adding the absolute value of the smalles negative value to all hints, upscaling of former hints would become possible. In both extensions however one looses the interpretation of one and zero.
The third method interpretes hints as a modification of an already existing model.
In an active learning setting point hints can be handeled without an model modification, by simply forcing this hints into the processing queue.

intuitive way to do this is ascribing an increase in probability to positive hints and and decrease in probability to negative hints.

\section{Formal descriptions}
Join and prod over parameter-lists form an idempotent semiring:

$(A, \cup)$ is a idempotent commutative monoid (or join-semilatice with zero) with identity element $\emptyset$:
$$(a \cup b) \cup c = a \cup (b \cup c)$$
$$\emptyset \cup a = a \cup \emptyset = a$$
$$a \cup b = b \cup a$$
$$a \cup a = a$$

$(A, \times)$ is a commutative monoid with identity element $[\ ]$:
$$(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$$
$$[\ ] \cup a = a \cup [\ ] = a$$

Product left and right distributes over join:
$$a\times(b \cup c) = (a\times b) \cup (a\times c)$$
$$(a \cup b)\times c = (a\times c) \cup (b\times c)$$

Product by $\emptyset$ annihilates $A$:
$$\emptyset \times a = a \times \emptyset = \emptyset$$
